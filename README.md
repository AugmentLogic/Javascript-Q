# QueryChain
QueryChain is a very small (5k) JavaScript library that is inspired by the JQuery library but is an entirly unique take on the concept. Our main goals behind this library is to maintain a very small core library that can be used to build a dynamic ui easily while maintaining its ability to be expanded on easily with plugins.
