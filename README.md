# The QueryChain Mission Statement
QueryChain is a very small JavaScript library is intended to reduce the javascript footprint on your websites or apps. Our main goals behind this library is to maintain a very small core library that can be used to build a very dynamic UI easily while maintaining its ability to be expanded on with plugins. In most cases the QueryChain core should be all that is needed to build a fully dynamic and ajax website UI.
